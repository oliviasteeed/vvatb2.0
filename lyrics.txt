I'm going nowhere

So much potential
So much spark
So much light up in the dark
I thought I knew you for a moment
Was it worth it?
Now it's gone but
<br>
I will remember
Life goes on
Another September
And I brace myself again against the air
That smells like Fall
<br>
I used to like that smell
Before it just meant you
Before it brought me back
To lighter times when I was dying
Freezing in the sunlight
<br>
And we walked around a lake
And before that I fell over
And before we got our ears pierced
And bought candles at the mall
<br>
And before that I sat in my room and watched my life go by
Wishing all the time away
But moments stay until you let them die
<br>
And now I moved away
And I have views of the big city
And I don't know how I got here
Mom I'm scared can you come get me?
<br>
Wide eyes open in the dark
When I ask myself each morning
Get out of my empty bed
When you wake up where are you going?
<br>
I'm going nowhere
I'm going nowhere
I'm going nowhere
I'm going nowhere
<br>
Hi independence
So much new
I've never had a better view
But still my nights and days are heavy with obsession
<br>
I guess I don't know how to be
When no one's taking care of me
I really liked the way we talked out all my feelings
But here I am
<br>
Brand new adult
Time to grow up, shut up, play the part
Stop seeking approval
Cause these people are my equals
<br>
And I realize identity
Was always a performance
And was being watched was the reason
I had all that motivation?
<br>
By myself I'm not the same
I don't think
I just do things
Cause I don't have to explain
I think I finally understand the population
<br>
Now that I moved away
And I have views of the big city
And I don't know how I got here
Mom I'm scared can you come get me?
<br>
Wide eyed open in the dark
When I ask myself each morning
Get out of my empty bed
When you wake up where are you going?
<br>
I'm going nowhere
I'm going nowhere
I'm going nowhere
I'm going nowhere

This one's about the aimlessness of being a godless, parentless, lost child who just moved out. Realizing it's your life now, yours to squander, is terrifying.



You never loved me at all

I look like I'm listening
When I see you now and then
I can see what's happening
I'm in control of everything
<br>
You know I'm not listening
Don't think I'll see you again
I can't see what's happening
I don't need you anyways
I can't find you or anything
<br>
And I try to make you happy
I try when it's not right
I try to understand you
I try to keep up so why
<br>
Why y y y'd
You never love me at all
All all all
You never loved me yet
Why y y y'd
You never love me at all
All all all
<br>
Always watch you in shiny things
Wandering eye for anything
I just want to be skin to skin
I just want you to be jealousied
<br>
Tempermental for the little things
Sentimental for reality
Got nostalgia for the ignorance
I'm a handful but you're always here
<br>
Yeah I try to make you happy
I try when it's not right
I try to understand you
I try to keep up so why
<br>
Why y y y'd
You never love me at all
All all all
You never loved me yet
Why y y y'd
You never love me at all
All all all
<br>
I wanted to make peace with you but you're always on me
Always on me
<br>
Can you do what I want you to?
I'm tired of fighting
Tired of fighting
<br>
I wanted to make peace with you
But you're always running
Always running
<br>
You know I can't handle the silence the stillness the feelings the waiting the wanting the nothing the way that I treat you is my way of coping
<br>
Why y y y'd
You never love me at all
All all all
You never loved me yet
Why y y y'd
You never love me at all
All all all
<br>
But why y y y'd
You never love me at all
All all all
You never loved me yet
Why y y y'd
You never love me at all
All all all
<br>
I know that one day
You'll stop it you'll see it
We'll look eye to eye and see
Nothing to hate
<br>
I know that one day
You'll stop it you'll see it
We'll look eye to eye and see
We're both the same
<br>
I know that one day
You'll stop it you'll see it
We'll look eye to eye and see
Nothing to hate
<br>
I know that one day
You'll stop it you'll see it
We'll look eye to eye and see
We're both the same

Dialogue between my mind and body about eating disorder experience.

Dramatic

Sometimes in my less proud times
I'm so reactionary
Say things overblown I know aren't true
Just to look deep or smart I guess
<br>
Sometimes I feel much better
I always get what I want
And nothing can upset me
And I don't think anyone is wrong
<br>
And nobody can tell me
But they wish they could
<br>
You don't have to be so dramatic
Not everything is the end of the world
You don't have to be so dramatic
You'll probably wake up tomorrow
<br>
You don't have to be so dramatic
Not everything is the end of the world
You don't have to be so dramatic
It's okay to be just a girl
<br>
Sometimes I'm the happiest
Before I get in over my head
And I live inside a dream again
Where I'm the most accepting
And I'm just so damn open minded
<br>
Sometimes I'm just honest
I'm not dumb I know it always ends
Let's fade back into strangers
So I can keep living in my head
And I'll fall into my place again
<br>
And they're all thinking "Move on!"
Oh I wish I could
<br>
You don't have to be so dramatic
Not everything is the end of the world
You don't have to be so dramatic
You'll probably wake up tomorrow
<br>
You don't have to be so dramatic
Not everything is the end of the world
You don't have to be so dramatic
It's okay to be just a girl
<br>
You don't have to be so dramatic
Not everything is the end of the world
You don't have to be so dramatic
You'll probably wake up tomorrow
<br>
You don't have to be so dramatic
Not everything is the end of the world
You don't have to be so dramatic
It's okay to be just a girl
<br>
It's okay to be just a girl
It's okay to be just a girl
It's okay to be just a girl

Got job offer in Ontario and spent a week agonizing about it. I never let anything go.

Who else?

I value you
More than my health
<br>
Want you around
More than myself
<br>
I hear your voice
In every sound
<br>
I would do anything
For that boy
Because who else?
<br>
I would do anything
Cause for you it doesn't feel like anything
I would do anything
I would do anything
For that boy
Because who else?
<br>
Know someday soon
You'll go away
<br>
I'll still remember you
Always
<br>
Your magnetic smile
And gorgeous personality
How everyone's your friend
And everything you say is interesting
<br>
I would do anything
Cause for you it doesn't feel like anything
I would do anything
I would do anything
For that boy
Because who else?
Who else who else?
<br>
I would do anything
Cause for you it doesn't feel like anything
I would do anything
I would do anything
For that boy
Because who else?

Had a conversation with some work friends about love is and I articulated that I think love is when you 'see' someone else to their core more than anyone else and you still profoundly admire and respect them and just want to be around them all the time. To the point where you'd do anything for them because there's nobody else, and nothing else. Taking care of them becomes taking care of yourself. I haven't felt this yet.


Tool in the box

I just hate that you've become
Another tool in the box
Another trip around the sun
Wasted
<br>
Feel it back down in my throat
When will it end I never know
Another place I haven't gone
Waiting
<br>
What am I in a rush for?
What am I still waiting for?
There's nothing more to run from
There's nothing more to live for
<br>
I guess that you can catch it
For a moment I had you
A spark of light and magic
But love is always transient
<br>
Don't ask me in the Winter
When all the warmth has faded
I said I had recovered
I'm learning to be jaded
<br>
And I forgot about you
How could I forget about you?
I never could
<br>
I just hate that I've become
Who I am I always was
Another change another fuss
Wasted
<br>
I hate that there's no control
Who I am is where I'm sold
My whole world is at your call
Waiting
<br>
What am I in a rush for?
Why am I still waiting here?
There's nothing more to run from
There's nothing more to live for
<br>
I know that you can catch it
Because I used to have you
A spark of light and magic
But love is always transient
<br>
Don't ask me in the Summer
When all that's new has faded
I said I had recovered
I'm learning to be jaded
<br>
And I forgot about you
How could I forget about you?
<br>
And I forgot about you
Spend my whole life
Forgetting about you
I never could

This one's also about eating and body image issues that come up over and over no matter how hard I try to resolve them and put them behind me. It's a coping mechanism at this point and I hate that I can't just let it go, but it's a symptom of another issue so can't be fixed in itself.

(Teach me how to love you)

Teach me how to love you
Love you

Teach me how to love you
Love you

Teach me how to love you
Love you

Teach me how to love you
Love you

No one taught me how
No one taught me how

The lyrics came to me while getting ready for bed and I ran over to the recording setup and made this interlude immediately. The start and end are the original voice memo I'm singing while putting away my face wash and the guitar is just me improvising which is why it's messy and not in time, but it kind of suits the theme of the song. Learning to love what you have takes fumbling around in the dark.

What were you like?

What were you like?
Sometimes I wonder
What were you like
When my mind wanders
What were you like?
Do you wish life was longer?
What were you like?
<br>
What were you like
What'd you see out these windows?
What were you like
Did you walk to the store?
What'd you buy at the store?
What were you like
How'd you arrange all these cupboards and drawers?
<br>
Cause I am at a loss
<br>
What were you like
Were there plants on the patio?
What were you like
Nicest pot on the stove
What were you like
How did this place look when it was your home?
<br>
What were you like
What did you spend your days on?
What were you like
When your family was gone
What were you like
Were you satisfied with the life that you then lost?
<br>
But I guess that's how it goes
<br>
What was it like when they picked up the pieces?
Was it expected or was it a shock?
The man I did business with
Your son or grandson
Your ending's the reason
For my brand new start
<br>
So I'll fill up the spaces
With hand-me-down furniture
Wipe off your handprints
Replace with my own
Birthdays and Christmas
Still happen like always
With brand new traditions I'll make on my own
<br>
And one day my letters
Will pile in the mailbox
One day my things gone, hastily disposed
Right now I've left everything to my brother
By then are there children? A family I loved?
<br>
And when the dust settles
They'll probably sell it
You need to let go
To move on with your life
A new young thing moves in seeking independence
It's all waves and cycles
The circle of life
<br>
They'll ask
What were you like?
What were you like?
<br>
They'll ask
What were you like?
What were you like?

Elliot and I moved out in July, and the previous owner of the apartment had passed away there, which made me feel even more existential than moving out of your parents' house just does. You feel aimless and you're really reminded of the agency you have in your life, and that where you live is your life. But when you move it's not a home yet, that takes energy and time, so you live in an empty box. And what would happen once I die and pass it on to the next person? How many people will get to live in this place? Sometimes I wonder.

Control of that

I like warm air and sunny days
But I don't have control of that
I like to get 9 hours of sleep
But I don't have control of that
I'd like to move on from your face
But I don't have control of that
My whole life I've been floating away
But I don't have control of that
<br>
Wonder if I want you now and then
But I don't have control of that
When every day ride past where you lived
And I don't have control of that
Get off the train where we used to kiss
But I don't have control of that
And now I'll never see you again
And I don't have control of that
<br>
Better that way
<br>
I swore I'd never repeat you
But I don't have control of that
Goddamn his smile is pretty cute
And I don't have control of that
Here we go again and again and again
And I don't have control of that
Life's always happening, never ends
And I don't have control of that
<br>
Spring flowers only rot away
And I don't have control of that
Rain falls, sun burns but never stays
But I don't have control of that
Life comes at you, cycles and waves
And I don't have control of that
Here I am running from it again
But I don't have control of that
<br>
Maybe one day
<br>
I'll stop at the sight of you
I know you're the only one
Wind blows all the clouds to move
I'm never replacing you
<br>
I'll stop at the sight of you
You're everyone I forgot
All the love I let go of
And now you're the only one
<br>
I'll stop when the curtains move
I'm not closing them for you
I'll open the windows up
I'll let all the insects in
<br>
I don't care it's immature
I don't care it's what I want
Just until it's what I don't
Just until we fall apart
<br>
And I don't want you to stay
From here you look like another phase
But you still own me some days
Cause I don't have control that way
<br>
Now I live in an empty room
And I have control of that
Now I never really talk to you
And I have control of that
I let everyone fall away
And I have control of that
But there will always be another wave
And I don't have control of that

This was the first song I wrote in our new apartment a couple days after moving on a quiet early July evening. It started as me trying to come to terms with the fact that our across the hall neighbour was smoking (in our non-smoking building) and that this would be my life now and I'd die young of lung cancer... But I don't have control of that. At that point I was also still pretty hung up on someone and scared to go back to university and just let all my dread and unsettled feelings out as things I just experience but don't have control over. You just have to recognize that life has cycles and waves and have faith that things will be good again. The ending is written to everything I want as preemptive gratitude for if ever I get it.

What you taught me

A long time ago I knew you, and
A long time ago you knew me
A long time ago I wanted to impress you cause
Back then didn’t see through you
<br>
Careful not to get too close
Cause I'd end up just like you
Want the world
Just so you can burn it down
<br>
Careful not to get too close
I'd end up living for you
Give up anything, even myself
<br>
But that was a long time ago now
<br>
And now you're gone
Now you're gone
But never forgotten
Cause I'm still doing
I'm still doing
What you taught me
<br>
Manic passion, it's not fun
You speak like it's the word of God
But you're not wrong
And I'm not sorry
<br>
I'd do it again
And again it would destroy me
<br>
Angry, cruel, smart, and kind
You're a lot of things in my mind
I'm not sure how to remember you
<br>
I was careful not to get too close
Cause I saw myself in you
End up like you if I didn't look around
<br>
Careful not to get too close
But we were living for you
Did it make you feel better about yourself?
<br>
But that was a long time ago now
<br>
And now you're gone
Now you're gone
But never forgotten
Cause I'm still doing
I'm still doing
What you taught me
<br>
And now you're gone
Now you're gone
But never forgotten
Cause I'm still doing
I'm still doing
What you taught me
<br>
And now you're gone
Now you're gone
But never forgotten
Cause I'm still doing
I'm still doing
What you taught me
<br>
And now you're gone
Now you're gone
But never forgotten
Cause my whole life
I'll be doing
What you taught me

This one is about a very passionate, hardass design instructor I had that pushed me harder and taught me more than anyone ever has. He changed the trajectory of my career and life, and I am so grateful for his dedication to that. His course also contributed to a relapse into anorexia, depression, complete loss of self esteem, confidence, and identity as a designer. I wore the same baggy clothes every day and put no effort into my appearance because I didn't want to give him more to critique and didn't feel like I deserved to feel good about myself when I wasn't a master of anything yet. How can you have been so positively and negatively impacted by someone? And when they pass away while you're on internship, how do you reconcile that? It took me almost a year to rebuild myself after that course, but I put into practice what he taught me every day in everything I do. People are complex.

Mama I'm a star now

Used to be a fake woman
Used to be a fake man
Used to be a fake lover
Used to be a fake friend
<br>
Used to being alone
Used to getting my way
Used to never letting go
Used to never want to stay
<br>
Used to being heartbroken
Used to be so open
Used to feeling the cold
Used to be sleepwalking
<br>
Used to be your Summer
Used to being something
Used to be afraid
Used it up always
<br>
Now I don't remember
<br>
Mama, I'm a star now
And you don't have
To watch me wake up
<br>
Mama, I'm a star now
And you don't have
To watch me wake up
<br>
Mama, I'm a star now
And you don't have
To watch me wake up
<br>
Mama, I'm a star now
And you don't have
To watch me wake up
<br>
Used to be naïve, I
Used to be starry-eyed
Used to be romantic
Used to be transparent
<br>
Used to be young and I
Used to know nothing, I
Used to lose my place, I
Used to hate the space
<br>
Used to hate the silence
Used to killing time and
Used to hurt myself and
Used to feel the judgment
<br>
Used to be a girl
Used to be your daughter
Never was a lover
Used to a fighter
<br>
Now I don't remember
<br>
Mama, I'm a star now
And you don't have
To watch me wake up
<br>
Mama, I'm a star now
And you don't have
To watch me wake up
<br>
Mama, I'm a star now
And you don't have
To watch me wake up
<br>
Mama, I'm a star now
And you don't have
To watch me wake up
<br>
Used to be a girl
But I'm still a daughter
Grown into a lover
Used to a fighter

It's nice to try to end an album on a happier song. The chorus for this one was floating around in my head for so long but I didn't know what to do with it. Eventually I just played some chords and let the verses come, and realized it was about feeling like you've come a long way, and maybe you don't need to be taken care of as much as you used to. Maybe you can take care of yourself now. The past year of being moved out and the year and a half before of working were so transformational for me. It's nice to look back sometimes and realize that although you aren't there yet, you've come a long way.

Bull in a china shop (cover)

I'm a kid in a candy store
I'm a bull in a china shop
I'm a tired old metaphor
For everything you can't afford
And everything you can't afford to be
<br>
I'm a public embarrassment
I'm a bottle of diet poison
I'm a walking advertisement
For everything I never meant
And everything I never meant to be
<br>
I can't hear a thing
Cause I stopped listening
<br>
I'm the reason I don't go out
I'm afraid I might sell me something
I'm the shadow of every doubt
I'm the product this song's about
I'm the product this song's about to be
<br>
I can't hear a thing
Cause I stopped listening
I can't hear a thing
Cause I stopped listening
<br>
Every morning
Since I was born
It's been hard to look in the mirror
And see my face by the horns
<br>
All the fun that the law allows
All the fun but with half the meaning
Come on over, I'll show you how
If you lived here you'd be home by now
If you still lived here you'd be home now with me
<br>
I can't hear a thing
Cause I stopped listening
I can't hear a thing
Cause I stopped listening

Before we really started recording The Next Album, Elliot and I were working on a covers album to get our mojo back after our setup and routines were shaken up by moving. We only started actually recording in January, and after a few covers were excited to get back to originals, but this one's meaning felt fitting on the album. Not knowing what to do and feeling like you're always doing the wrong thing. Also nice to pay homage to The Barenaked Ladies who we've been listening to since childhood and have influenced how we conduct ourselves as musical artists who don't take ourselves too seriously.

(When you wake up where are you going?)

When you wake up where are you going?<br>
When you wake up where are you going?
<br>
When you wake up where are you going?
<br>
When you wake up where are you going?

This interlude opens the album because it's kind of the thesis statement: when you wake up where are you going? What are you doing with this life? Oftentimes I do not know, and even more often I feel like I'm actively making the wrong decisions for myself at every given time. I recorded this for fun on my first (and last) time exploring the mood altering experiences legal in BC and think it has kind of a loose, dreamlike feel that most of our work doesn't have, and sets up the uncertainty of the album well.

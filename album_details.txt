It's Never Enough

the first album we recorded together. about dreams and growing up.

This album is about becoming an adult and figuring out who you are, loneliness, social isolation, hearts warmed and broken, family, friends, romance.
<br><br>
I wrote it when I was 20-21 and think it conveys the existential rollercoaster of being young, and figuring out who you are. I am still no closer to figuring that out, but I realize that might just be the reality of being alive?
<br><br>
It’s a very personal, very honest reflection of my experiences, emotions and thoughts. Welcome to my brain that always says no matter what you are doing, what you have, what you have accomplished, or who you are, it’s never enough.

Anxious Avoidant

a hot to the touch album about baby’s first breakup!

This album (written between August 2023 and January 2024 and recorded from December 2023 to July 2024) is about reality, whereas most of the last one (It’s Never Enough) was about fantasy.
<br><br>
It is the result of being pulled into somebody else's world, which is fun and exciting and overwhelming and scary and uncertain and sometimes doesn't work out. This how I dealt with that.
<br><br>
These songs are a snapshot of me learning to live with that vulnerability, and impermanence, and actually enjoy them. At the end of the day, I want to feel something different, because it gives me something to explore with lyrics and music, my absolute favourite thing in the world. Life's just cycles of experience and expression, it's not that deep.
<br><br>
I wanted Anxious Avoidant to have a slightly heavier sound, because we're all adults now. Since starting to work on this album, we've both grown up a lot (especially me). As much as some of these songs feel so immature and emotional, at the end of the day, authenticity is my core value as an artist. Honesty is what makes the songs interesting as a snapshot in time. As much as I change, I hope I can always channel my unfiltered emotions and feelings into music regardless of how it makes me look. I mean, I called the album Anxious Avoidant, at least I'm self aware (although I don't think that label is even true anymore).
<br><br>
Biggest thanks in the world to Elliot for absolutely slaughtering every chord strum, piano hit and drum track. We usually loop the guitar backing, and then record the rest as one track through the whole song, which is insane when you're playing drums at 180BPM or guitar soloing or or or. I do some the vocal tracks as one take but honestly most of our songs have like 100 stems and 50 of them are background vocal layering.
<br><br>
I’m glad this, our second album, is finally out because I’m already done writing the next one (it’s called sex, drugs, and open mindedness LMAO) and halfway through the next (tentatively called citygirl). These songs are close to my heart, but I am happy to let them go because it's been so long, they don't really feel like mine anymore.
<br><br>
Until next time (hopefully soon),

The Next Album

a undecided album about transitions and adulthood.

This is an album about getting to what's next, and not knowing what's next after that.
